In order to run the code:
Step1: Extract files to preferred directory
Step2: Open command line and navigate into the "Wumpus-No-Wumpus/out/production/CS411_mdp/" path
Step3: Run command "java Main" to compile my Main.class contained within the directory path
Step4: Input valid directory location of .txt file formatted after the sample mdp_input example 	
       e.g. C:\Users\UserName\Documents\example_directory_mdp
       NOTE:(mispellings in original .txt file, I have revised and attached a new .txt file with corrected spelling but same formatting can modify given file or
	     revise original given .txt file with correct spelling)

Step5: If path not valid, repeat steps 3-5.
Step6: If testing multiple times, repeat steps 3-6.
